# NAME

Task::BeLike::TOKUHIROM - modules I use

# DESCRIPTION

This [Task](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Task) installs modules that I need to work with. They are listed in this distribution's cpanfile.

# MY CRITERION

- I don't like the module breaks backword compatibility.
- I don't like the module makes slow the my script's starrting up time.
- Simple and small library is great.
- I don't like the module wraps and it provides ::Easy interface.

    Most of ::Easy stuff does not provides all features.
    A short time later, I need to switch the original library. \*Sigh\*
